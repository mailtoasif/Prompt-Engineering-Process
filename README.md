# Prompt-Engineering-Process
This repository is dedicated to the exploration and development of prompt engineering techniques and processes. As part of my internship in the RTC league as a prompt engineer, this project aims to document and share the best practices, methodologies, and tools for creating effective and efficient prompts for various applications.
